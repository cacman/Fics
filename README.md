What if Nobu or Hachi didn't go to the fireworks festival?  
What if Nobu opened the door?  
Change the narrative as kami-sama to recreate your desired ending of the fireworks festival!

## so you're probably wondering if you have an ao3, why are you posting here?

the truth is, writing interactive fiction on ao3 is extremely limited. it's great for basic stuff, like linking scenes together or having some basic text. but when it comes to making it pretty by putting images and laying stuff out on a page, it's cumbersome and involves a lot of bending of the limited css they allow.

in addition i wanted to introduce some kind of save system, since max confidant plus plus is intended to intertwine all the stories, so each story isn't just a one shot. and when i came up with my nana interactive fic i realized the power of variables adds something unique and useful for keeping things tidy.

## twine

so i've transitioned to writing my stories in twine. twine is an interactive fiction engine made specifically for these types of stories. it has all sorts of customization (more than i will ever understand) that regular hyperlinking on ao3 can't provide.

you can learn all about the twine game engine [here](http://twinery.org/)

as it is a game engine, each fic will be self contained in an html file with javascript, which can be opened in most modern browsers.

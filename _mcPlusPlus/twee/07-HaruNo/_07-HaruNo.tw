This series is going to be about sexual relations after max confidant for each of the characters (yes, that includes the guys as well)
Therefore, this series is based around underage sex. Though in my opinion it isn't a big deal since Ren is already banging everyone at max confidant anyway.

Ok so don't call me out but I did take some direct quotes from Persona 5.

Disclaimer: This is a <b>fantasy</b>. I <b>do not</b> condone any non-consensual sexual actions, even as little as touching someone that doesn't want to be touched.
Please practice safe sex, and get tested <b>before</b> doing anything wild.

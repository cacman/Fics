<h1>Bump, Set, Kill: Shiho's Key to Ann's Secret Fantasy (Atlus Clean Version) PLAY LIKE THE GAME</h1>
<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
After Shiho makes her peace with her previous self on the school roof, she reveals her ulterior motive, creating a rift in Ann and Ren's relationship.
Or so it seems.

The story is structured as a cutscene dialog with choices.
I've rewritten the series in the twee scripting language, using <a href="https://twinery.org/">twine</a> as a visual organizer, <a>tweego</a> as a main compiler, and a custom python script to port ao3 text to twee readable format.

Yes this will have an explicit dlc like the other ones (got any ideas for a title?). It's not going to have any crazy dominatrix stuff yet, since their relationship is still new. (I'll eventually write it in Haru's fic: https://archiveofourown.org/works/27578222/chapters/67460798). And come on, there's Shiho. I want to make it at least semi-wholesome.

Thank yous:<br />

This series is going to be about sexual relations after max confidant for each of the characters (yes, that includes the guys as well)
Therefore, this series is based around underage sex. Though in my opinion it isn't a big deal since Ren is already banging everyone at max confidant anyway.

Ok so don't call me out but I did take some direct quotes from Persona 5.

Disclaimer: This is a <b>fantasy</b>. I <b>do not</b> condone any non-consensual sexual actions, even as little as touching someone that doesn't want to be touched.
Please practice safe sex, and get tested <b>before</b> doing anything wild.

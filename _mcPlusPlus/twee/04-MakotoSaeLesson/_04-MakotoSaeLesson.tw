<h1>Makoto and Ren Get a "Lesson" From Sae (Atlus Clean Version) PLAY LIKE THE GAME</h1>
<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
After Makoto and Ren "study some things (they) don't have experience yet", Makoto invites Ren to hangout the next day.
Little does Ren know that Makoto has something else planned in mind.
And little does Makoto know what Sae has been scheming.

The story is structured as a cutscene dialog with choices.
I've rewritten the series in the <a href="https://github.com/Rizean/twee3">twee</a> scripting language, using <a href="https://twinery.org/">twine</a> as a visual organizer, <a href="https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/">tweego</a> as a main compiler, and a custom python script to port ao3 text to twee readable format.

This series is going to be about sexual relations after max confidant for each of the characters (yes, that includes the guys as well)
Therefore, this series is based around underage sex. Though in my opinion it isn't a big deal since Ren is already banging everyone at max confidant anyway.

Ok so don't call me out but I did take some direct quotes from Persona 5.

Disclaimer: This is a <b>fantasy</b>. I <b>do not</b> condone any non-consensual sexual actions, even as little as touching someone that doesn't want to be touched.
Please practice safe sex, and get tested <b>before</b> doing anything wild.

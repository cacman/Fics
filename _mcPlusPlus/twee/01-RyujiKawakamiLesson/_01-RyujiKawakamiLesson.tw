<h1>Ren, Ryuji, and Mishima Get a "Lesson" From Kawakami (Atlus Clean Version) PLAY LIKE THE GAME</h1>
<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
After the failure of Operation Maidwatch, Ren has had quite the relationship with Kawakami. They scheme together to recreate Operation Maidwatch for Mishima and Ryuji with a happy ending.

The story is structured as a cutscene dialog with choices.

Yes this will have an explicit dlc like the other ones (got any ideas for a title?). It's not going to have any crazy dominatrix stuff yet, since their relationship is still new. (I'll eventually write it in Haru's fic: https://archiveofourown.org/works/27578222/chapters/67460798). And come on, there's Shiho. I want to make it at least semi-wholesome.

Thank yous:<br />

This series is going to be about sexual relations after max confidant for each of the characters (yes, that includes the guys as well)
Therefore, this series is based around underage sex. Though in my opinion it isn't a big deal since Ren is already banging everyone at max confidant anyway.

Ok so don't call me out but I did take some direct quotes from Persona 5.

Disclaimer: This is a <b>fantasy</b>. I <b>do not</b> condone any non-consensual sexual actions, even as little as touching someone that doesn't want to be touched.
Please practice safe sex, and get tested <b>before</b> doing anything wild.
